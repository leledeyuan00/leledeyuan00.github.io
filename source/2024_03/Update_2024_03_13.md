## Gazebo Version Change: Garden -> Fortress

Due to the EOL of Garden, we need change the Gazebo version from Garden to Fortress.

Please reference the following steps to update:


## Remove the Garden

[Garden Install & Uninstall Guidance](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu)

`sudo apt-get remove gz-garden && sudo apt-get autoremove`

## Install the Fortress

.
`sudo apt-get install ignition-fortress`


## Update the gazebo_ws

Following the [(2. Install the Gazebo ROS2 Package by binary)](https://github.com/smartrobotsdesignlab/denso_robot_ros2?tab=readme-ov-file#2-install-the-gazebo-ros2-packages-by-binary). On the ReadMe of denso_robot_ros2 package.


## Update the Denso and Garment Packages

`cd` to `denso_robot_ros2` package, `git pull` on the `master` branch.

`cd` to `garment_robot` package, `git pull` on the `master` branch or the `teleop` branch.

## New Version Notes

Now we don't need manually edit `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH` environment variable on the `~/.bashrc` anymore. It would be automatically generated by:

```xml
<export>
    <gazebo_ros gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/../"/>
</export>
```
Loacated on the `package.xml` on the description folder.
