ATI Sensor development
======================

It's wired, when I first run the SOEM as root user. I can observe the topic on the narmal user terminal, just cannot read the data on this topic.

And when I tried to set the environment by :

.. code-block:: console
    
    export FAST = xxx

It is work!

BUT! When I try it agian just several hours later, it doesn't work! 
And the scence is so wired that I even cannot see the topic and node if any nodes run on the root.

How to solve it?

.. note:: 
    Maybe I can try to reset the UDP transmission.
